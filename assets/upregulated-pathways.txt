Pathways that are upregulated in disease

Quantification: Over 70% of the enzymes were upregulated

Arginine & Proline Metabolism

Gluconeogenesis

Pentose Phosphate Pathway (Cycle)
  - Notably, non-oxidative phase

PRPP Biosynthesis

Pyruvate Oxidation

Glycogen biosynthesis, glucose-1P => glycogen/starch

Guanine ribonucleotide biosynthesis IMP => GDP,GTP

Uridine monophosphate biosynthesis, glutamine (+ PRPP) => UMP 

Valine/isoleucine biosynthesis, pyruvate => valine / 2-oxobutanoate => isoleucine 

Isoleucine biosynthesis, threonine => 2-oxobutanoate => isoleucine

Ornithine biosynthesis, glutamate => ornithine

Arginine biosynthesis, ornithine => arginine

Arginine biosynthesis, glutamate => acetylcitrulline => arginine

Histidine biosynthesis, PRPP => histidine 

Tryptophan biosynthesis, chorismate => tryptophan

Coenzyme A biosynthesis, pantothenate => CoA

Glutathione biosynthesis, glutamate => glutathione

C1-unit interconversion, prokaryotes
